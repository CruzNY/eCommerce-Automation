# E-Commerce Automation Framework

Selenium automation project that I have started on my own from scratch.
I am using Cucumber Framework and Java along with my experience and really anything that I've absorbed from work and my fellow QA co-worker.

Trying to implement best practices and overall just trying to improve as a Engineer/Developer.
